title: About
---


I'm Steve; I'm a bit of a technology nerd primarily focusing on Kubernetes, platforms and the adjacent technologies; but I have a broad range of interests and I often find myself nerd-sniped by something new and interesting on [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/) or [Lobsters](https://lobste.rs/).

I have worked in the technology industry since 2005 and I like to think that I'm a comb shaped engineer; I have a broad range of experience and knowledge but I also have a few areas where I have deep expertise. I regularly contribute to multiple diverse OSS projects, I maintain a number of personal OSS projects on GitHub, and I have a couple of GitHub orgs where I'm attempting to build a community ([Action Stars](https://github.com/action-stars) & [Terr4m](https://github.com/terr4m)).

During the day I work as a Senior Systems Architect for [Lexis Nexis Risk Solutions](https://risk.lexisnexis.com/) where I'm primarily focused on our Kubernetes and cloud native architecture. As my role is very hands on, I work with a lot of different technologies and often have to dig deep into the implementation to understand how they work and how they can be used to solve our problems.

Outside of technology and work I enjoy spending time with my family, playing sports, and drinking craft beer.

I'm always interested in a good conversation and my DMs are open, so feel free to reach out on my socials (see below).

I also should add that all opinions expressed on this blog are my own and do not represent the views of my employer or any other organization that I am affiliated with.
