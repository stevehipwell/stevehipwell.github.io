I work as a Senior Systems Architect for [Lexis Nexis Risk Solutions Group](https://risk.lexisnexis.com/group) where I'm focused on our Kubernetes and cloud native architecture. I love to geek out on Kubernetes and the adjacent technologies and love discussing them with others. Outside of the actual technology I'm passionate about platform engineering and am an adherent of the "everything as code" movement.

In my spare time I enjoy sports, technology, DIY and craft beer!
