### Or, why I'm finally going to start blogging

It's been almost 3 years since my last post and a lot has changed in that time. Also a lot hasn't changed; like my inability to find the time to blog about all of the thoughts that I have and the interesting things that I work on. I love learning new things and I love sharing what I've learned with others, so why haven't I been blogging? I think this primarily comes down to the time pressure of work and family life, but I also think that I've been putting too much pressure on myself to write long, detailed posts. So I'm going to try to change that and start writing shorter, more frequent posts about the things that I'm working on and the things that I'm learning.

So in an effort to prompt myself to write some posts, the topics that I currently have in my head include the following.

- KubeCon EU 2025
- [KCP](https://www.kcp.io/)
- Terraform providers
- GitHub API & automation
- GitHub Actions
- [Karpenter](https://karpenter.sh/)
- GitOps
